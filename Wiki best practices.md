## Use images and screenshots
Whenever you're struggling to get your point across or feel things could be clearer, consider a visual.
## Write concisely
Stick to short, sharp sentences. Think about it like note-taking. Try to avoid any jargon that may confuse your reader.
## Structure and categorize information
So crucial for searchers. Build out a wiki map that's searchable by category or keywords.
## Share it with the right people
Using the admin rights you have, select who has access to what information and what can be accessed by anyone.
## Get others to contribute
You don't need to build this wiki alone; in fact, it's better with specialists. Figure out who they are and ask them to contribute.
