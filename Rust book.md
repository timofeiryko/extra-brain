# Foreword
Rist is about **empowerment**

For example, “systems-level” work:
- Programmers who need to “dip down” into lower-level control can do so with Rust, without taking on the customary risk of crashes or security holes, and without having to learn the fine points of a fickle toolchain
- For example, introducing parallelism in Rust is a relatively low-risk operation

But Rust isn’t limited to low-level systems programming:
- It’s expressive and ergonomic enough to make CLI apps, web servers, and many other kinds of code quite pleasant to write
- Working with Rust allows you to build skills that transfer from one domain to another; you can learn Rust by writing a web app, then apply those same skills to target your Raspberry Pi
