## Well-being support
The 1-on-1 meeting is the best way to deal with a noticeable lack of motivation, a need to progress faster, 'hitting a wall' with the non-technical task, a need for some emotional support, someone to talk to
- Discord → Support → well-being_support (for general career questions and additional 1-on-1 meetings)
