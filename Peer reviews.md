The reviewers could be either other learners, JTLs or STLs.

For each project, an individual number of required corrections by learners (or JTLs) and STLs will be set. Somtemies STLs can do corrections instead of JTLs/peers, but not conversely.

Criteria “general understand of the topic” includes sprint content, question to test understanding the topics can be asked.

Missing the corrections is really bad, acorrector is allowed to mark a student as "no-show" if the student is late for more than 5 minutes.

To pass the review stage of a project, your average mark should be 70% or higher. In order to promote accurate scoring, STL reviews have a higher weight than peer reviews.
