I could just compose that I am fond of biology and bioinformatics so the genetics and biotechnology specialisation interests me most, but it is worth justifying why I am attracted to biological sciences. I suppose the main reason is the graceful complexity of living organisms, which appeared as a result of evolution, so there is no such phenomenon in other sciences. Actually I am interested in biology since an early age: I participated in different study groups, went on many expeditions for field research and studied in the biology class of the best school in our country (it was AESC MSU). But there was a moment when I realized that I am really interested in biology. While I was walking in the forest during one of the research expeditions, I saw an anthill and decided to observe it. I noticed that ants, which have very simple brains, somehow magically choose the optimal path to the pieces of food, so I started thinking about how this happens, and when I didn't find a good enough explanation, I asked my teacher about it. He explained to me that when ants go, they spray pheromones that attract other ants. Shorter paths take less time to reach the good, so the most optimal paths have the highest pheromone concentrations, and the bad paths that are less marked evaporate over time. And when I understood this mechanism, I had a great sense of insight how beautifully this system works, and thanks to this feeling, I still learn biology.

However, more specifically going back to the Genetics and biotechnology programm I would like to point out that the set of study subjects is quite suitable for me and I was pleasantly surprised to see the course of plant physiology in the second module - since I am interested not only in bioinformatics, genetics, etc., I like plant physiology. I suppose it is a relatively poorly studied area, in which many interesting mechanisms will be discovered that will be useful for plant biotechnology in the future.

Notwithstanding the above, I am always skeptical of my beliefs soI do not rule out the possibility that during studying on this program I will understand, for example, that Bioengineering and robotics interests me most. This will not be a problem for me, because one of the significant advantages of the Science and technology program for me is flexibility, the opportunity to understand what I'm really interested in and not make a mistake with the choice of specialization.

Another feature of this program, which seems to me an advantage is a large number of practical classes and projects - I am convinced that project-oriented education is extremly effective. The other point about projects in compare with theoretical knowledge is that in the 21st century, I can easily learn any discipline on my own with online courses and books, but I actually need this university to learn how to do real research.

However, university is not only about studying different subjects and gaining useful skills, it is about networking too. I am sure that new friends around the world are not only pleasant for me during my studies, but also useful in the future for my career and travel. And in my opinion in Tartu there are good conditions for making new acquaintances in the academic world: there are a lot of international students, the university participates in international events like iGEM and I want to paricipate in it. I think I will achieve success in this competition, as I already have the experience of successfully speaking at scientific school conferences (I received the title of laureate), I also participated in team competitions in which teams had to come up with solutions to non-standard biological problems and then discuss, criticize each other's solutions, and then were evaluated by the jury. My other achievements are the title of medalist of the Lomonosov Biology Olympiad, a three-time winner of the regional stage of the All-Russian School Biology Olympiad (I would have participated in the final stage, but it was canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic), and right now I am preparing for the next final stage and I have a great chance to perform well. In the process of preparing for various olympiads, I studied with different teachers, participated in many practical classes, and I think it was a great experience. So I have an academic adaptability and I am able to assimilate information from different people in the different forms. I love not only participating in competitions, but also my own projects: for example, I recently coded my own website to create a database of questions on biology for students who are preparing for the olympiads

So I think I will choose iGEM as one of the elective courses and participate in this competition. However, there are a lot of other interesting courses here . Firstly, I really like the course called Artificial Muscles, because it is very nteresting topic for me as a biologist and I suppose it is extremely promising technology so it is good idea to know how it works. The second couse I prefer is Laboratory Projects, because as I mentioned above only at university I can gain practical skills and it is very uesefull. Finally, Principles of Entrepreneurship interests me because I am considering starting my own biotech startup in the future and I probably will need my entrepreneurial skills.

Actually I have a dream to create my own company that will, for example, analyze the human genome for preventive purposes and give recommendations on lifestyle, as well as help parents with genetic diseases give birth to healthy children using biotechnology. In general, I love biology and natural sciences, because they make our lives better, and only the study of biology, bioinformatics and biotechnoilogy in the future will lead to the fact that we can overcome disease, aging and death.

Of course, before starting my own company, I'm going to build an academic career, and I'm confident that the research skills I'll gain by completing the Science and Technology program will help me to do it.
