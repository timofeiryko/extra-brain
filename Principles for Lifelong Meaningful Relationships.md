1.  **Unwavering belief that nothing is more important than the relationship** helps to sustain relationships through the bad times and large or small disagreements. You just have to have faith that it’s true and act as if it’s true and then see if the other person does the same. However, you need to think hard about how important the relationship you have really is relative to how important getting your way is.
2.  **If you need to assess the value of your relationship, think hard about whether your most important values and principles are aligned, putting the really important ones ahead of the not so important ones.** Remmber:

	- he greatest things to have in life are great relationships, especially your most important relationships
	- you won’t be able to have great long-term relationships if you can’t get past the the disagreements and the imperfections because all relationships have disagreements and imperfections
	- no relationship will work in the long run if your most important values and principles are not aligned
	- it takes a whole lot of trying and figuring things out in order come up with the best path

3. **The key to all good relationships is to:
	- be in sync about how you should be with each other, especially how you should disagree and get past your disagreements
	- give far more than you demand with those who will do the same with you

All people have some notion about how other people should behave, but these views are different. How to deal with disagreement:
1) step out of the disagreement for the moment to see if you can't establish an agreed-upon principle about how you should be with each other
2) go back into the disagreement keeping in mind your new principle
3) in the future: operate by that principle and modify the principle in the same way

When in doubt, give each other slack rather than be prickly. Just make each other happy without empathetically considering the other’s perspective.
