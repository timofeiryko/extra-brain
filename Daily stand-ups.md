[[Turing College]]

For learners, to talk about:
- what they have done in the past day (roughly 1 min, a to-do list will make it easier)
- what their plans are for today (less than 1 min)
- what issues (impediments) they are encountering that are preventing them from progressing

At Turing College, we also give some time for people to share:
- The biggest ‘a-ha!’ moment of the past day

The people attending your stand-up meetings will be all the learners in your team, your STL, JTLs (they can be from other groups too), and occasionally members of Turing College staff as well (we are very keen to regularly keep in touch with all of our learners!).

If somebody is struggling with a topic that you have already mastered - offer to have a 1-1 session with them after the stand-up.

If there’s  a very quick answer to an issue that somebody cannot seem to find - give short guidance immediately.
