# Learning techniques

### Desirable difficulty

Or how difficult is it to learn exactly what you need to become a pro. Desirable difficulties are obstacles that make learning more challenging, slower, and more frustrating in the short term, but better in the long term.

- **Generation effect**: information is better [remembered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory") if it is generated from one's own mind rather than simply [read](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_(process) "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_(process)")
- **Hypercorrection effect**:  the more confident a learner is of their wrong answer, the better the information will stick when they subsequently learn the right answer

**At Turing College, struggle is real, and really, really useful for your long-term success.**

### Spaced repetition

If you revise the information you already know regularly over a specific period of time, you will retain that knowledge longer.

At Turing College, we use quizzes as a form of systematic spaced repetition practice that will push you to revise the topics you have already assigned. Quizzes won’t be assessed.

### Asking & getting & providing help

We had even made a step forward by creating an economy of points in peer-assignments. Being helpful increases the chances of successful employment.

Making a proactive contribution:
- improve your experience
- help you to create  meaningful relationships

[[Principles for Lifelong Meaningful Relationships]]

At Turing College, learners should try to solve a problem on their own for 20 minutes and then seek help.

Stack Overflow (for technical support):
-   Related to coding, mathematics, data science, or course curriculum in general   
-   Questions that can be only answered by STLs

Discord (for non-technical support):
-   Related to career, community, events, well-being, organizational matters
-   Requests for help or support on an abstract problem (only if the situation cannot be converted into a technical question)
-   Non-course related topics like elections to interesting reading material

### P2P learning

P2P learning is the practice of solving complex challenges with another person.

-   The Pros of P2P learning
    
    -   Allows learners to teach and learn at the same time
        
    -   Provides a safe place to work on difficult problems
        
    -   Expands a learner's perspective on problems they may have already solved in the past
        
    -   Introduces learners to working with team members in the workplace
        
-   Cons of P2P learning
    
    -   Relying too heavily on peers to get a project done
        
    -   Strong personalities can take control of the r decision making process for too long without realizing it
        
    -   Copy-pasting of code or ideas without understanding how they work
        
    -   Working for extended periods of time on complex problems with peers can create emotional burnout and strain communication

### Start with “why”

Which of the basic needs is fullfilled by the Turing College? What is your real motivaion?

### Virtual and physical environment

1) Ergonomics: decent chair, setting your monitor at the proper height etc
2) Incorporate organization into each task that you do (good file management etc)
3) Use time management strategies to focus on work and take restful breaks
4) **It is important to get enough sleep (7-8 hours)**, maintain a routine (Maslow’s pyramid)
5) Don’t be afraid of frustration, but do plan activities that will help to deal with it
6) Minimize distractions while you’re working (social medial especially)
7) Set social boundaries with friends and family
8) If you feel that you are on the edge of burnout, the best thing to do is take a day off (just don’t forget to inform the community team)
