# Self-paced learning

Learners can dictate the speed that they progress through projects. However, students **don't** have the opportunity to spend less than the pre-set time on their course week per week.

Our data so far suggests that the most common optimal amount of time learning per week is 20- 30 hours.

We take Lithuanian public holidays off, during which our staff might not be available to help you and during which our regular meetings & events will not happen either.

### Activities
- [[Daily stand-ups]]
- Quizzes on the Turing Platform (particular score is not needed)
- 1-1 meetings with [[JTLs]], [[STLs]], and Turing Staff
- [[Peer reviews]]
- Helping others via Zoom calls or in Discord voice channels
- Being active on Discord (ability to be a great team player, will definitely improve your chances of getting hired)

### How to do self-paced learning efficiently?
- Make learning a regular habit
- Use a [[Problem-solving framework]] (experiment with several frameworks to find which works for you best)
- Be competitive with yourself, not others

### What do I do if I easily understand the content?
There are 2 options:
- Move through the course quicker after you’ve done what's expected on that topic. This will allow you to finish the full course faster if that is your goal.
- Spend more time on that topic by delving deeper into it:
	- different connected topics (feel free to ask STL’s for guidance here)
	- work on the project, doing more than the main requirements ask for
	- help other learners who might be struggling with that topic
	- Inform College about the interesting topics to show initiative - a trait that is valued by employees!

### How to deal with struggles?
- Check if there are no pre-course topics that are holding you back [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1p6XPqLbXv8_iwmFWdwPE28EM_iMEoLeN)
- Ask others for help ([[TC support]])
- Mention this in the standup
- Arrange a 1-1 meeting with the Community Team to discuss any factors, that don't relate to the study programm
- If you believe the course content is lacking and that this is what is holding you back, contact the Head of Education

### Real problems?

A learner can receive **3 warnings** throughout the whole course. In the worst-case scenario, the last warning may lead to consequences: changes in the learner’s contract, payment type, loss of employment guarantee, or a learner’s removal from our course.
