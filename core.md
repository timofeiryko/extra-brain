#syntax
# Concept
The idea of this knowledge base is to bridge Zettelkasten and Wiki. We can say that Wiki is a tree of structured information and cross-linked random ideas or notes are leaves on this tree.
# Architecture
Topics marking and semantic connection between notes are achieved by links to relevant notes.
Different types of content are marked by different tags:

![[tag_list]]

By default, type of content of the note without any tag is "idea". ^a16e23
## Specific rules
We use only markdown syntax for better and easier compatibility. However, there are some additional rules:
- Notes about syntax, architecture are named like "default_note"
- "Meaning notes" are named like "Default note"
- One note - one idea. Even when we are talking about Wiki, nesting is achived by "title notes" or embedding text. This is because it is easier to reference the note than some particular part of note
- Storage of files, coding projects etc is achieved by links to GitHub, Google Drive etc
- Anchor and syntax notes are English-only
- Wiki tag should have a parent note after it or a brief decription of the Wiki if the note is a core of some Wki
