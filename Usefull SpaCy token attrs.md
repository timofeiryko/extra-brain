[[Python NLP]]

Here I collect tokens that I really USED or learned from some course, it isn't a documentation :)

Get info:
- `text`
- `lower_` 
- `i` token ID

True/False lexical attributes:
- `is_alpha`
- `is_punct`
- `like_num` ("one" is also a number)

Generated by piplines (depend on context):
- `pos_` or `pos`- predicted part-of-speech tag (rom the [Universal POS tag set](https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/).)
- `dep_` or `dep` - predicted dependency label
- `head` - syntactic head token (the parent token this word is attached to)
- `lemma_` or `lemma` - initial form of this word
