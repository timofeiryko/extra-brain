# Data Science Course

**Part -** the smallest piece of the curriculum, ~10 hours
**Sprint -** a larger piece of the curriculum requiring ~50 hours to complete, usually 5 parts

**Project -** a Part dedicated completely for practical work, requires 1 STL and 1 peer correction to be passed

**Capstone project -** a practical task at the end of a module that takes a whole sprint

**Module** - largest piece of the curriculum, usually made up of 3 Regular Sprints and 1 Capstone Project Sprint, ~ 200 hours

**Specialisation module** - a module that a learner chooses from a pool of options depending on the data roles and companies that they plan on applying to, ~ 200 hours. Choosing a specialisation module of a company just increases (but doesnâ€™t guarantee) your chance of successful application to that company. Purposes:course
-   Acting as an impressive portfolio items to show to employers
-   An opportunity to get a taste of what projects and work will look like at specific companies
-   Deepening your knowledge in a specific area that you have learned about so far in the course
-   Learning new things that are required by specific specialisations or companies

Only our gold Hiring Partners are preparing specialisation modules. As with the current date (2022-02) Turing College gold partners are: NordSec (a.k.a. Tesonet), Satalia, Biomapas, KiloHealth, iSun, Macaw, Argyle. Because we saw a need, we have also created an additional Turing College specialisation module that although not targeted at a specific gold partner, would covers topics that we see would be useful for a wide range of other Hiring Partners that do not have their own specialisation modules.
