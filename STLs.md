STLs are experts from the IT industry.

There are two primary ways to get help from STLs:
- Daily stand-ups: the STL will then be able to advise you on the best way to proceed, but it might be that a co-learner will be able to help you with the problem and an STL will not be needed
- Getting help during project corrections
- Attending or watching videos of live-demonstrations: to arrange one, a team should inform the STL if such demonstrations are needed during daily stand-ups
